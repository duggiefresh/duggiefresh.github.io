NFL Sunday. Woo hoo. Go Niners.

This weekend I got a bunch stuff done for the site. Today I've
switched out some icons and cleaned up the sidebar.

I'm using [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) and
[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/). So far it has been a pretty
good experience.

In the future, I think I'm going to go over some stuff I learned from
playing with Scheme.
