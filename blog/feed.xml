    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is an example article. You probably want to delete it and write your own articles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties —just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man—I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?—but sometimes there's a man. Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit praesent ac. You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. Magna justo pellentesque ac lectus quis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov! Elit blandit fringilla a ut turpis praesent felis ligula, malesuada suscipit. Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacifists. Smokey was a conscientious objector. Malesuada non, ultrices non urna sed orci. What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?! Ipsum, placerat id condimentum rutrum, rhoncus ac lorem aliquam placerat posuere neque, at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus, man, can you change the station? Dignissim magna ullamcorper in aliquam sagittis massa ac tortor ultrices. These men are nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of. Faucibus curabitur eu mi. He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. Sapien, ut ultricies ipsum morbi eget risus nulla nullam vel nisi enim, vel auctor. Is this your homework, Larry? Ante morbi id urna vel felis lacinia placerat vestibulum turpis nulla, viverra.&lt;/p&gt;
